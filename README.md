# Planning

- This application will be a calendar that stores information on any selected month and day, and allows them to retrieve that same inforamation for later.

- There will be at least 3 pages:

  # Admin page

  - Administrator dashboard that allows interaction with user accounts ( WIP )

  # Register Page

  - Users register an account here.
  - Validation should be in place to prevent duplicate registrations
