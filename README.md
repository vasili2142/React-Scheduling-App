# Planning

- This application will be a calendar that stores information on any selected month and day, and allows them to retrieve that same inforamation for later.

- There will be at least 3 pages:

  # Admin page

  - Administrator dashboard that allows interaction with user accounts ( WIP )

  # User Page

  ~~Here the user can see information about what they've entered into the calendar~~
  - Keeps information about user bookings and cancel activities they've signed up for

  # Schedule Page

  - Lists the activities users can sign up for on a day-to-day basis
  - Activities should have a button called "Sign Up" which users can click to create a booking for that activity
  
  # Register Page

  - Users register an account here.
  - Validation should be in place to prevent duplicate registrations

  # Login Page

  - Users login through this page
  - Validation should be in place to ensure the application does not simply redirect to the user page


  ## IDEA GRAVEYARD

  ~~# Calendar/Form page~~
  ~~Display the calendar~~

  ~~- The application is meant to be a booking system where the user creates a task that gets sent to the admin for approval. The admin either accepts, or rejects the request. Handling requests is not something familiar to me.~~

# Possible Risks

- 

- Application might not have full admin implementation to handle requests as this is something I've never done

- This project is also 1 of 3 finals that I need to complete. Managing time will be key to making worthwile progress.
